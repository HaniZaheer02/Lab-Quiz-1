# ðŸ“š University Library Lending System

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The **University Library Lending System** is a management platform designed to handle the lending and return of books at a university library. The system enforces borrowing rules based on user standing, due dates, fines, and book availability. Key features include:

- User eligibility verification (member status and account standing)
- Book lending and return tracking
- Automatic fine calculation for late returns
- Book renewal functionality (if eligible)
- Reservation tracking to prevent renewals
- Special handling for high-demand "reserve" books (in-library use only)

This system aims to streamline library operations, improve the user experience, and ensure fair access to resources.
